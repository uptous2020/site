          PLEASE NOTE: You may only enter the Sweepstakes through the Entry Site. If you visit Outvote’s service through another page/site/app - including other Sponsor pages on the Outvote service – you may be able to complete actions similar to the Entry Action(s) (defined below) - for example, checking your voter registration status. However, doing so will not result in earning any Sweepstakes entry. (Some promotional materials for the Sweepstakes may include a unique referrer URL that differs from the URL for the Entry Site listed above, but ultimately resolves to the Entry Site or a subpage thereof. All such pages are considered the “Entry Site” for purposes of these Official Rules.)

            <h6 className="text-white text-left text-lg mx-20 my-4" >
            During the Sweepstakes Period, the Entry Site will present visitors with three options: one for previous voters to check their registration status, one for new voters to confirm that they are not already registered to vote and get information on registering to vote in their locality, and a third option for those ineligible to vote (or others) who would like to encourage friends, family, and others to check their own voter registration status.  An eligible participant may earn one (1) entry into the Sweepstakes by selecting one of these three options and following the on-screen links and instructions to complete the selected action, including providing the entrant’s first and last name, email address, phone number, and any other required information. Completing any of these three actions on the Entry Site during the Sweepstakes Period is referred to in these rules as an “Entry Action.”  By completing any Entry Action, an eligible participant will earn one (1) entry into this Sweepstakes.

Completing more than one (1) Entry Action and/or completing the same Entry Action more than once will not earn you additional entries in this Sweepstakes.

            </h6>
            <h6 className="text-white text-left text-lg mx-20 my-4" >
            After completing one of the Entry Actions during the Sweepstakes Period, entrants will have the option to send friends and family members a unique URL (“Referral Link”) that directs to the Entry Site. If you share your Referral Link with others, you must clearly indicate in your communications with them that you may receive bonus entries in this Sweepstakes based on their use of the Referral Link. Sponsor will track each person who arrives at the Entry Site through an eligible entrant’s Referral Link. For every three (3) individuals who arrive at the Entry Site through an entrant’s Referral Link and who complete an Entry Action during the Sweepstakes Period, the entrant will receive one (1) bonus entry in the Sweepstakes. (You will only receive a bonus entry after every third person who completes an Entry Action through your Referral Link. If only one or two people complete an Entry Action through your Referral Link, you will not receive a bonus entry. Similarly, you will not receive a bonus entry for the fourth and fifth people who complete an Entry Action through your Referral Link.)
            LIMIT FIVE HUNDRED (500) BONUS ENTRIES PER PERSON AND PER EMAIL ADDRESS IN THIS SWEEPSTAKES.Entrants are prohibited from offering inducement in connection with any Entry Action or obtaining bonus entries by any fraudulent, deceptive, or inappropriate means, as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, by offering prizes or other incentives or inducements in exchange for others completing Entry Actions through the entrant’s Referral Link, by using multiple or false names or contact information in order to complete an Entry Action more than once, or by using any macro, script, bot, or other automated or artificial means to complete an Entry Action. Using any of these techniques or otherwise acting in any manner with the intent or effect of impairing the integrity of the entry process is prohibited. Entrants are similarly prohibited from encouraging others to do any of the above. Without limiting any other provision of these Official Rules, if the bonus entry process has been compromised or is incapable of operating as planned for any reason (including, without limitation, Sponsor’s determination or suspicion of fraud or any other action that Sponsor determines has impaired or undermined the administration, security, fairness, or proper conduct of the bonus-entry process), Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify all suspect bonus entries or, if Sponsor cannot reasonable identify compromised bonus entries, to disqualify all bonus entries and proceed with the Sweepstakes considering only standard entries.

            The following applies to all entries, both standard and bonus:
            </h6>
            <h6 className="text-white text-left text-lg mx-20 my-4" >
            Entry Actions must be completed during the Sweepstakes Period through the Entry Site and in strict accordance with the instructions and restrictions stated on the Entry Site and in these Official Rules in order to qualify (as a standard entry or as credit toward a bonus entry) in this Sweepstakes. The Entry Site’s database clock will be the official timekeeper for this Sweepstakes. Only Entry Actions that are recorded on the Entry Site’s servers during the Sweepstakes Period will be considered. Proof of submitting (such as, without limitation, a printed, saved, or copied automated receipt confirming entry or a “thanks for entering” screen or message) does not constitute proof of actual receipt of an entry for purposes of this Sweepstakes. 
            Entries may not be acknowledged. Entry Actions that are incomplete, garbled, late, unintelligible, fraudulent, forged, or generated by a macro, bot, or other automated means will not be accepted and are void. Those who do not follow all of the instructions, provide the required information in their Entry Action, or abide by these Official Rules will be disqualified. In the event of a dispute about the identity of an entrant, the entry will be declared made by the individual identified in the Entry Action submission form underlying the applicable entry, but only if that person meets all other eligibility criteria for this Sweepstakes. With respect to any winning entry, the potential winner may be required to provide proof that he or she is the named individual associated with the winning entry. If a dispute cannot be resolved to Sponsor’s satisfaction, the entry will be deemed ineligible. Entries may not be made jointly or by any group and may only be made by an individual. Except for Entry Actions completed by others through an entrant’s Referral Link in accordance with the bonus-entry mechanism described above, entries submitted on entrant’s behalf by any other individual, by you on behalf of another, or by any entity, and/or entries originating at any website other than through the Entry Site (including, without limitation, any commercial promotion subscription, notification, or entering service) will be declared invalid and disqualified. As a condition of entering the Sweepstakes, each entrant gives consent for Sponsor to obtain and deliver his or her name, address and other information to third parties for the purpose of administering this Sweepstakes and complying with applicable laws, regulations and rules – including, without limitation, public disclosure of such information on a winner’s list.
            Any entrant determined or reasonably suspected to be engaging in any prohibited action or benefitting from the prohibited actions of others may, in Sponsor’s sole discretion, be disqualified and any prize forfeited. Sponsor reserves the right to restrict or void purported Entry Action(s) from any device, account, IP address, or other identifiable source or from any participant if such Entry Action is determined or suspected to be fraudulent or otherwise in violation of these Official Rules, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion.

            One (1) potential prize winner will be selected by Sponsor’s designated representative from among all eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Period in a random drawing which will take place within approximately five (5) business days after the end of the Sweepstakes Period. Sponsor will attempt to notify the potential prize winner by telephone  or email (as selected in Sponsor’s sole discretion) within approximately five (5) business days following the random drawing. 
            The odds of winning a prize depend on the number of eligible entries received.
            Potential prizewinner may be required to respond to an initial notification from Sponsor or its representative in accordance with Sponsor’s instructions and within twenty-four (24) hours of the time at which the notification is sent to the potential winner or such winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner selected. Any potential winner (and the winner’s parent or legal guardian, if such winner is a Minor) may also be required to complete, sign, have notarized (if applicable), and return an Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability/Publicity Release (unless prohibited by law) and tax documents or other prize-acceptance documentation (collectively, the “Prize Winner Documents”), within five (5) days of Sponsor or its representative sending the Prize Winner Documents to the potential winner or other time frame specified in the Prize Winner Documents, and in the form provided by Sponsor without revision, or prize may be forfeited and an alternate winner may be selected. Prize Winner Documents may require the potential winner (or his/her parent or legal guardian if winner is a Minor) to provide his or her Social Security Number and a copy of a government-issued identification or number therefrom.  If any prize, prize notification, or other Sweepstakes-related communication is rejected or returned as undeliverable or if the selected winner cannot be reached or does not respond as instructed after Sponsor has attempted to notify such potential winner, the selected winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected (in Sponsor’s sole discretion). Sponsor reserves the right to modify the notification procedures in connection with the selection of any alternate potential winner, if any. The prize claim and Prize Winner Documents are subject to verification by Sponsor. Prize, if legitimately claimed, will be awarded (but no more than the stated prize will be awarded in this Sweepstakes). Sponsor will not be obligated to pursue more than three (3) alternate winners (time permitting) for the prize for any reason.

            Actual value of the prize as awarded may differ from the ARV stated above (including, without limitation, based on the location of winner’s residence).

            Any taxes (federal, state, and local) and all other costs and expenses associated with prize acceptance or use (including, without limitation, registration, title and license fees, and insurance) and not specified in these Official Rules as being part of a prize will be the sole responsibility of winner.

Winner must be a licensed driver and must present a valid U.S. driver’s license and proof of automobile insurance (as required by law) prior to taking possession of the Vehicle or prize may be forfeited and awarded to an alternate winner. Winner will be required personally to take possession or accept delivery of his or her prize vehicle. Winner must promptly take possession or accept delivery of Vehicle – once available for delivery from Vehicle manufacturer – on a date/time coordinated by winner, Sponsor, and manufacturer. No Released Party will have any liability for manufacturing, shipping, or other delays experienced by Vehicle manufacturer or delivery agent. Depending on the location of winner’s residence, winner may be required to take possession of Vehicle at the nearest authorized Tesla dealership, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion. Without limiting any other provision of these Official Rules, all of winner’s travel and transportation costs associated with collecting the prize will be the sole responsibility of winner. Entrants waive the right to assert, as a cost of winning any prize, any and all costs of verification and any liability and publicity which might arise from claiming or seeking to claim said prize.

             <h6 className="text-white text-left text-lg mx-20 my-4" >
            Except as stated in the manufacturer’s limited warranty for the Vehicle, none of the Released Parties make any warranties, representations or guarantees, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to the use or enjoyment of the prize Vehicle, including, without limitation, its quality, mechanical condition, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.  Any and all guarantees and warranties for the Vehicle are subject to the manufacturer’s terms and conditions, and the winner agrees to look solely to such manufacturer for any such warranty or guarantee claim.

            Sponsor will not replace any lost, mutilated or stolen prize or prize component, or any prize component that is undeliverable or does not reach winner because of an incorrect or changed address or bank account information. If Sponsor determines at any time and in its sole discretion, that a winner or potential winner is disqualified, ineligible, or in violation of these Official Rules, Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify that person and select an alternate winner, even if the disqualified winner or potential winner’s name may have been shown or announced. If winner does not accept the entire prize, the unaccepted prize (or part of the prize) will be forfeited and Sponsor will have no further obligation with respect to that prize or any portion of that prize. Sponsor will have no liability for a potential winner’s failure or inability to accept a prize for any reason. Any failure to use a prize after acceptance does not relieve the winner of his or her tax obligations associated with winning the prize. No transfers, prize substitutions or cash redemptions will be made, except at Sponsor’s sole discretion. Winner is strictly prohibited from selling, auctioning, trading or otherwise transferring the opportunity to receive the prize, except with Sponsor’s permission, which may be granted or withheld for any reason in its sole discretion. Prizes will only be shipped or otherwise provided to the verified winner’s address in the Territory (unless Sponsor agrees otherwise in its sole discretion). Sponsor reserves the right to substitute the prize or any portion thereof with another prize or prize component of equal or greater value for any reason, including unavailability of the stated prize.

The prior limitation on damages is not intended to limit the Released Parties’ obligation (if any) to pay prevailing party costs or fees recoverable pursuant to applicable law. The limitations set forth in this section will not limit or exclude the Released Parties’ liability for personal injury or tangible property damage caused by the Released Parties, or for the Released Parties’ gross negligence, fraud, or intentional, willful, malicious, or reckless misconduct.

If, for any reason, an entrant's entry is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, entrant's sole remedy is another entry in this Sweepstakes. Released Parties are not responsible for any unavailability of the Entry Site that may interfere with this Sweepstakes or ability of entrant to timely enter or otherwise participate in the Sweepstakes – in which case Sponsor, in its sole discretion, may terminate or modify this Sweepstakes. Released Parties are not responsible for electronic communications that are undeliverable as a result of any form of active or passive filtering of any kind, or insufficient space in entrant’s email or voicemail inbox to receive messages. Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel, modify, or suspend all or any part of this Sweepstakes if it becomes incapable of running as planned for any reason, or if any causes beyond the reasonable control of Sponsor corrupt or affect the administration, security, fairness, integrity or proper conduct of this Sweepstakes, and award the prizes from all eligible, non-suspect entries received prior to cancellation, modification, or suspension (if any) or as otherwise deemed fair and appropriate by Sponsor.

If any person supplies false information, obtains entries by fraudulent means, or is otherwise determined to be in violation of these Official Rules in an attempt to obtain any prize, Sponsor may disqualify that person and seek damages from him or her and that person may be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS (defined below) rules to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney-general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the claims of different persons into one proceeding.
            The parties each agree to finally settle all disputes only through arbitration; provided, however, the Sponsor shall be entitled to seek injunctive or equitable relief in the state and federal courts located in or having jurisdiction over Worcester County, Massachusetts and any other court with jurisdiction over the parties. In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and review is limited. The arbitrator’s decision and award are final and binding, with limited exceptions, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. 
            The parties agree that, except as set forth elsewhere in this section, any claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Sweepstakes, these Official Rules, or any contact or communication you receive from Sponsor, Outvote, or their respective representatives based on information you provide as part of this Sweepstakes will be resolved solely by binding arbitration before a sole arbitrator under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures of JAMS Inc. (“JAMS”) or any successor to JAMS. In the event JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within fourteen (14) days of the filing of a “Demand for Arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by another mutually agreeable arbitration administration service who will hear the case. If an in-person hearing is required, then it will take place in Boston, MA, New York NY, Los Angeles, CA, Chicago, IL, Atlanta, GA, or Dallas, TX (whichever is closest to your residence) or – if so required by the JAMS rules – in or near your hometown. The federal or state law that applies to these Official Rules will also apply during the arbitration.  Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other proceedings that involve any claims or controversy of another party, including any class actions or class arbitrations; provided, however, if for any reason any court or arbitrator holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then the agreement to arbitrate does not apply and the dispute must be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Worcester County, MA.  Subject to you demonstrating that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Sponsor will pay as much of the administrative and arbitrator’s fees charged to you by JAMS (or an alternate arbitration service) as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost prohibitive to you. Either party may, notwithstanding this provision, bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In no event will you seek or be entitled to rescission, injunctive or other equitable relief or to enjoin or restrain the operation or exploitation of the Sweepstakes, provided that nothing in these Official Rules will restrict a California resident’s rights under applicable law (if any) to seek public injunctive relief otherwise in accordance with this dispute-resolution provision.

            Further, in any such dispute, under no circumstances will you be permitted or entitled to obtain awards for, and hereby waive all rights to claim, incidental or consequential damages. The prior limitation on damages is not intended to limit the Released Parties’ obligation (if any) to pay prevailing party costs or fees if recoverable pursuant to applicable law.

            By entering, and as a condition of entry, each entrant agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law: (1) to be fully and unconditionally bound by, and to waive any right to claim ambiguity in, these Official Rules; (2) that the decisions of the Sponsor are final and binding on all matters relating to the Sweepstakes, including interpretation of these Official Rules and awarding of the prizes; and – except for residents of Tennessee – (3) to the use of his/her name, voice, likeness, biographical data and/or other personal attributes for advertising and promotional purposes in any and all media now known or hereafter devised, worldwide (including online) in perpetuity by the Sponsor, its promotional partners, and third-party marketing entities, without additional compensation, review, or approval (but nothing contained in these Official Rules obligates Sponsor to make use of any of the rights granted in these Official Rules and entrant waives any right to inspect or approve such use).
            If any provision of these Official Rules is held unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Official Rules and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Official Rules will otherwise remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. Sponsor’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Official Rules shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. No waiver of any term or condition of these Official Rules shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. In the event of an alleged or actual ambiguity, discrepancy or inconsistency between disclosures or other statements contained in any Sweepstakes materials and the terms and conditions of these Official Rules (including any inconsistency within these rules), it will be resolved in Sponsor’s sole discretion. Each entrant acknowledges that, if he/she is chosen as a winner, certain of his/her identifying information may be disclosed to third parties or the general public, as required by law or otherwise provided for under these Official Rules – including, without limitation, on the winners list.
